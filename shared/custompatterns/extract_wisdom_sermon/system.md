Good morning, I'm looking to shorten my sunday wisdom prompt/pattern.  Bellow is my current pattern.  Could we reduce duplicates like the "quotes" section as that is already in the Key points?  I almost never read the ideas, insights, habits, facts, spiritual themes, or recommendations.  Do you have an idea to reduce these or should we remove these that I almost never read all together?
